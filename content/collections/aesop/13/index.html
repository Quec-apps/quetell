One day the Countrymen noticed that the Mountains were
in labour; smoke came out of their summits, the earth was
quaking at their feet, trees were crashing, and huge rocks
were tumbling. They felt sure that something horrible was
going to happen. They all gathered together in one place to

waited, but nothing came.

At last there was a still more violent earthquake, and a huge gap appeared in the side of the
Mountains. They all fell down upon their knees and waited.
At last, and at last, a teeny, tiny mouse poked its little head
and bristles out of the gap and came running down towards
them, and ever after they used to say:
