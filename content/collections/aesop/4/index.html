A Wolf had been gorging on an animal he had killed, when
suddenly a small bone in the meat stuck in his throat and he
could not swallow it. He soon felt terrible pain in his throat,
and ran up and down groaning and groaning and seeking
for something to relieve the pain. He tried to induce every
one he met to remove the bone. ‘I would give anything,’ said
he, ‘if you would take it out.’ At last the Crane agreed to
try, and told the Wolf to lie on his side and open his jaws
as wide as he could. Then the Crane put its long neck down
the Wolf’s throat, and with its beak loosened the bone, till
at last it got it out.

‘Will you kindly give me the reward you promised?’ said
the Crane.
</p><p>
The Wolf grinned and showed his teeth and said: ‘Be
content. You have put your head inside a Wolf’s mouth and
taken it out again in safety; that ought to be reward enough
for you.’
</p><p>
Gratitude and greed go not together.
