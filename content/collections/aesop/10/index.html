Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running
up and down upon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who
placed his huge paw upon him, and opened his big jaws to
swallow him. ‘Pardon, O King,’ cried the little Mouse: ‘forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows but
what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?’
The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able
to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go.
</p><p>
Some time after the Lion was caught in a trap, and the hunters
who desired to carry him alive to the King, tied him to a
tree while they went in search of a waggon to carry him on.
Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing
the sad plight in which the Lion was, went up to him and
soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the
Beasts. ‘Was I not right?’ said the little Mouse.
Little friends may prove great friends.
