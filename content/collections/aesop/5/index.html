A Countryman’s son by accident trod upon a Serpent’s tail,
which turned and bit him so that he died. The father in a
rage got his axe, and pursuing the Serpent, cut off part of
its tail. So the Serpent in revenge began stinging several of
the Farmer’s cattle and caused him severe loss. Well, the
Farmer thought it best to make it up with the Serpent, and
brought food and honey to the mouth of its lair, and said to
it: ‘Let’s forget and forgive; perhaps you were right to punish
my son, and take vengeance on my cattle, but surely I was
right in trying to revenge him; now that we are both satisfied why should not we be friends again?’
</p><p>
‘No, no,’ said the Serpent; ‘take away your gifts; you can
never forget the death of your son, nor I the loss of my tail.’
Injuries may be forgiven, but not forgotten.
