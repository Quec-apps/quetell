The Frogs were living as happy as could be in a marshy
swamp that just suited them; they went splashing about caring for nobody and nobody troubling with them. But some
of them thought that this was not right, that they should
have a king and a proper constitution, so they determined
to send up a petition to Jove to give them what they wanted.
</p><p>
‘Mighty Jove,’ they cried, ‘send unto us a king that will rule
over us and keep us in order.’ Jove laughed at their croaking,
and threw down into the swamp a huge Log, which came
downrplashto the swamp. The Frogs were frightened out of
their lives by the commotion made in their midst, and all
rushed to the bank to look at the horrible monster; but after a time, seeing that it did not move, one or two of the
boldest of them ventured out towards the Log, and even
dared to touch it; still it did not move.
</p><p>
Then the greatest
hero of the Frogs jumped upon the Log and commenced
dancing up and down upon it, thereupon all the Frogs came
and did the same; and for some time the Frogs went about
their business every day without taking the slightest notice
of their new King Log lying in their midst. But this did not
suit them, so they sent another petition to Jove, and said
to him, ‘We want a real king; one that will really rule over
us.’ Now this made Jove angry, so he sent among them a big
Stork that soon set to work gobbling them all up. Then the
Frogs repented when too late.

Better no rule than cruel rule
