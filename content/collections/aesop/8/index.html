A Lion had come to the end of his days and lay sick unto
death at the mouth of his cave, gasping for breath. The animals, his subjects, came round him and drew nearer as he
grew more and more helpless. 
</p><p>
When they saw him on the point of death they thought to themselves: ‘Now is the time
to pay off old grudges.’ So the Boar came up and drove at
him with his tusks; then a Bull gored him with his horns;
still the Lion lay helpless before them: so the Ass, feeling
quite safe from danger, came up, and turning his tail to
the Lion kicked up his heels into his face. ‘This is a double
death,’ growled the Lion.
