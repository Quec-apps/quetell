Once upon a time a Wolf was lapping at a spring on a hillside, when, looking up, what should he see but a Lamb just 
beginning to drink a little lower down. ‘There’s my supper,’ 
thought he, ‘if only I can find some excuse to seize it.’ Then 
he called out to the Lamb, ‘How dare you muddle the water 
from which I am drinking?’
</p><p>
‘Nay, master, nay,’ said Lambikin; ‘if the water be muddy 
up there, I cannot be the cause of it, for it runs down from 
you to me.’
</p><p>
‘Well, then,’ said the Wolf, ‘why did you call me bad 
names this time last year?’
‘That cannot be,’ said the Lamb; ‘I am only six months 
old.’
</p><p>
‘I don’t care,’ snarled the Wolf; ‘if it was not you it was 
your father;’ and with that he rushed upon the poor little 
Lamb and ate her all up. But before she died she gasped out 
<br>
.’Any excuse will serve a tyrant.’
