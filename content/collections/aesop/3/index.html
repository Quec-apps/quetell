The Lion went once a-hunting along with the Fox, the Jackal,
and the Wolf. They hunted and they hunted till at last they
surprised a Stag, and soon took its life.
</p><p>
Then came the question how the spoil should be divided. ‘Quarter me this Stag,’
roared the Lion; so the other animals skinned it and cut it
into four parts. Then the Lion took his stand in front of the
carcass and pronounced judgment: The first quarter is for
me in my capacity as King of Beasts; the second is mine as
arbiter; another share comes to me for my part in the chase;
and as for the fourth quarter, well, as for that, I should like
to see which of you will dare to lay a paw upon it.’
‘Humph,’ grumbled the Fox as he walked away with his
tail between his legs; but he spoke in a low growl .’You may
share the labours of the great, but you will not share the
spoil.’
